![Final Score](https://i.ibb.co/DCtw70t/image.png)

## Project Description
The `minishell` project is a simple Unix shell implementation developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. It allows users to execute commands, manage processes, and handle input/output redirection. This project emphasizes understanding shell functionalities, process management, and memory handling in C.

## Journey
This project was a significant learning experience, requiring multiple iterations to achieve a fully functional shell. My initial attempts faced challenges with command parsing and process execution. However, through persistent debugging and testing, I was able to refine my implementation and create a robust shell environment.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding shell architecture and command execution
- Implementing process management and handling signals
- Managing input/output redirection and pipes
- Memory management and dynamic memory allocation in C
- Debugging and optimizing shell performance

## Technical Details
- The shell supports basic command execution, including built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, and `exit`.
- Key features include:
  - Command parsing with support for pipes and redirections.
  - Environment variable management.
  - Signal handling for user interruptions (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- The shell is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear prompts and error messages.

## Project Status
- **First Attempt**: Success (Fully Functional Shell)
- **Completion Time**: ~12 days

## Challenges Faced
The most challenging aspects of this project included:
- Designing a robust command parser that handles various input formats.
- Implementing process management and ensuring proper execution of commands.
- Debugging issues related to memory leaks and resource management.
- Ensuring smooth handling of signals and user interactions.

## Reflection
While this project was one of the more complex ones at 42, it significantly enhanced my understanding of Unix systems and shell programming. The iterative process of refining my approach taught me the importance of thorough testing and debugging in creating a reliable shell environment.

## Skills Developed
- Shell architecture and command execution
- Process management and signal handling
- Input/output redirection and pipes
- Memory management
- Debugging and performance optimization
